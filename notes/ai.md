# AI course

## Getting started
### Natural vs Artificial Intelligence
- **natural** - learning but take a lot of time
- we are tool builders
- computer scientist create ai
### History
1. 1950
- can machines think?
- **Turing Test** -> imitation game, is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human
2. 1956
- artificial intelligence terms start use
- explore if machines could stimulate variouus aspects of human intelligence
3. 1960s - 1970s
- known as **AI winter**
- technology and data availability limitation -> *reduced fundings and interest in AI research*
4. 1997
- **IBM Deep Blue** defeated world chess champion (Garry Kasparov)
- AI start gain attention
5. 1990s - 2000s
- known as **Advancement of Technology**
- Internet start growing up
6. 2006
- **Deep learning** have been explored by Geoffrey Hinton
- inspired by how the human brai works
7. 2011
- **IBM's Watson AI** won the "Jeorpardy!" quiz show
- showcase advances in NLP
8. 2012
- **Deep Neural Networks** article published by Jeff Dean and Andrew Ng
9. 2017
- **Google Brain** - huge breakthrough in NLP by introducing *transformer*
- allow to process text efficiently
10. 2018
- **OpenAI** released *GPT1*
- generative AI technology utilized `Transformer`to build **LLM**
11. Late 2022
- **ChatGPT** released

### AI vs Data Science vs Machine Learning
![ai-ds-ml](/images/ai-ds-ml.png)  
- **AI** claims to make machine intelligence, learn new skills
- **Machine learning** is AI key subfields - predict outcome
- **Data Science** work with ML - but, DS often use statistical method, rely on math, statistics and data visual

### Weak vs Strong AI
- **Narrow AI** - a machine that is able to perform specific task that it's been designed to do
- Semi-strong AI -> ChatGPT 3.5 (2022)
- Artifical General Intelligence (AGI) - Strong AI
- **AGI** should be able to create science on its own

## Data is essential for building AI
### Structured vs Unstructured Data  
1. **Structured Data** -> organize into row and columns (considered more valuable)
2. **Unstructured Data** -> text files, images, videos (lacks defined structure, but VALUABLE INSIGHTS $$$)
### How data have been collected  
![mnist](/images/mnist.png)  
- **MNIST Database** -> basic for student who want to learn ML (70k, 28 x 28 pixel images of handwritten digits)
- computer use ```binary form (0s & 1s)``` to store and process the data
- computer is trained to recognize numerical sequences
- AI get all the data by *scraping the web, accessing APIs and harnessing big data analytics*  
```Garbage DATA IN, Garbage DATA OUT```  
```Great DATA IN, Great MODEL OUTPUT```
### Labelled and Unlabelled data
1. **Labelled Data**
![labelled-data](/images/labelled-data.png)  
- reviews each photo and classifying the image
- also works with text, audio, video and other data types
- more reliable but time consuming and expensive
2. **Unlabelled Data**
![unlabelled-data](/images/unlabelled-data.gif)  
- quicker and cheaper
- ml advancements now allow us to work with UNSTRUCTURED data
- need to train the AI model
### Metadata: Data that describes data
- much of nowadays data is unstructured and too voluminous to label
- metadata **proves invaluable** here
1. **Metadata** -> Data that describes other data
- Type of asset
- Author
- Date created
- Usage
- File size, etc.  
```Your data should have metadata```
